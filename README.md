This project is not in development anymore. Instead, the idea is to use a small cheap VESC and install it inside the TSDZ2 motor, or outside, in a DIY way. Then a very small ESP32-C3 board, running high level Python firmware, read the sensors and send the commands to VESC to control the motor -- this is already done for other EBike motors lke Bafang M500 motor, or to Xiaomi M365 scooters or even more powerful 2000W microscooters as Fiido Q1S, see here:

This ebike motor controller firmware project is to be used with the Tongsheng TSDZ2 mid drive motor with controller v1. [See here for V2](https://github.com/OpenSourceEBike/TSDZ2_motor_controller_v2).

It has the following benefits compared to the stock firmware:
* The motor runs more efficient therefore it becomes more powerful and consumes less energy.
* The ebike will feel more responsive and agile.
* Using other supported displays and pheriperals will provide more functionality and features. Because this project is in heavy development more features will be added.

This project is being developed and maintained for free by a community of users. Some of them are developers who work professionally developing this type of technology for very well known companies.

For more details, see the project page: https://github.com/OpenSource-EBike-firmware/TSDZ2_wiki/wiki 

**IMPORTANT NOTES**
* Installing this firmware will void your warranty of the TSDZ2 mid drive and KT-LCD3.
